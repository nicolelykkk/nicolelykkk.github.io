                <p>The Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) is an American media franchise 
                and shared universe centered on a series of superhero films, 
                independently produced by Marvel Studios and based on characters 
                that appear in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. 
                The shared universe, much like the original Marvel Universe in comic books, 
                tablished by crossing over common plot elements, settings, cast, 
                and characters.(From WIKIPEDIA)<br>

                The motivation behind the visualization I chose to create for my 
                data set was my enthusiasm for Marvel comics and movies. 
                My visualization is trying to convey the connections between Marvel 
                characters. They are connected because they are in at least one affiliation. 
                very interesting to see some people are both good and bad.  
                What is more, you can click the button on the top of this webpage 
                in order to see those characters in different affiliations. 
                When you click the AVENGERS button, those circles of characters 
                who are one of the Avengers will turn to steel blue. When you click 
                the HYDRA button, those circles of characters who are one of Hydra will 
                turn red. It shows the connections in an efficient way. When you are 
                hovering your mouse on each circle, you can see some information about 
                the character. 
                Besides, I want this visualization to look like the stars in order to 
                keep the uniform style. With the text next to the circles, it now looks 
                like shooting stars.</p>
